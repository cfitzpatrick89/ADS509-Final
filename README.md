# Exploring the Impact of Climate Change and Public Health Using Text Analysis

# Project Overview

This project aims to investigate the impact of climate change on public health by analyzing scientific research papers through text mining techniques. By extracting key words and phrases, we aim to identify how climate change affects public health. Our methods include TF-IDF analysis, topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and key phrase extraction to uncover important themes, significant terms, and emerging trends in the literature. This analysis will provide insights into the relationship between climate change and public health.
